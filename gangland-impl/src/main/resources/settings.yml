# |      Settings Configuration      | #
# +----------------------------------+ #

# If you have faced any problem with the file, you can create a new one by changing [Config_Version] to a different
# number.
# However, when a new update comes out by default, the config version would have a different version resulting in a new
# file.
# The old version file would have a suffix '-old' to indicate they are from the old version.
# Every YAML file from this plugin supports this feature, even if the configuration section of [Config_Version]
# wasn't explicitly mentioned.
# Adding this section and changing the value would result in the same functionality, otherwise it won't recreate the
# file.
Config_Version: '${project.version}'

# +---------------+ #
# | Update Config | #
# +---------------+ #

# Get notified and updated for a new release of the plugin.
Update_Checker:
   # It is recommended to be left enabled since it doesn't take any space in the RAM.
   Enable: true
   # Only privileged players will be notified when they join if there is a new update.
   Notify_Privileged_Players: false
   # This feature will auto-install the update into the plugin's own folder, inside a folder called 'release'.
   Auto_Download: true

# +-----------------+ #
# | Language Config | #
# +-----------------+ #

# Messages language type. You can create a custom language by simply creating a folder called 'message' and inside it
# the language.
# You should respect the prefix of the file name, it should be message_xx.yml, and xx can be any letter you prefer. To
# switch between the languages, you enter the xx values in the 'Language' configuration, and it would load that
# configuration.
# Any faulty written language names entered to this attribute 'Language' then the plugin would disable. To make the
# plugin work, use any valid language. To get the list of the available languages, enter an invalid name, and a message
# of the available list suffix would be displayed.
Language: en

# +----------------------+ #
# | Resource Pack Config | #
# +----------------------+ #

# This plugin contains a custom resource pack that can be used in the server.
# A manual download is applicable if there was any problem faced.
Resource_Pack:
   Enable: true
   # This is the direct download url link.
   URL: "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1ynhOxjyvQn9QhIQ8y_Lf-iU97FQwMj-x"

      Host: localhost

      # It is recommended to set this true
      Failed_MySQL: true
   Auto_Save:
      # Enabling auto save would clear update the databases.
      # If disabled, it would write to the database and clear the cache only when the player leaves or when the server
      # closes.
      # Disabling this option is not recommended since it would create a lot of overhead to the CPU every time a user
      # leaves.
      # This effect takes place when the server contains a large number of player bases or players constantly joining
      # and leaving the server.
      Enable: true

# | Scoreboard Config | #
# +-------------------+ #
Scoreboard:
   Enable: true
   # The plugin supports multiple drivers, and each driver has its own algorithm and way of updating scoreboards.
   # Drivers' list:
   #  1) Driver_V1: Caches the lines into memory and uses a clustering algorithm that updates similar line intervals
   #                each tick.
   #  2) Driver_V2: Caches the lines into memory similar to Driver_V1 algorithm. The difference is it uses a built-in
   #                library to manage the clusters.
   #  3) Driver_V3: Uses interactive scoreboard to temporarily disable the main one and use the alternative scoreboard.
