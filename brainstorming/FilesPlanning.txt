A total overhaul to the database system needs to be addressed.
The system needs a group of tables rather than a group of databases.
Each table would contribute to a structure of other tables to do a specific job.
A set of entities would be addressed along with advanced database system modeling would be implemented to ease the use
of resource management system.

Entities:
	- User data
		-> Member (offline data)
		-> Bank
	- Gang data
		-> Settings
		-> Ally
	- Rank data
	- Waypoint data

	* Future plans:
		- Safe data
		- NPCs data
		- Auction info

In the database, the specified tables will have these specific contents.

	- uuid (pk)		(\str\)
