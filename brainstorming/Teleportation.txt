All data is saved in database or file?

Should each gang have a single or multiple warps?

Should the plugin have spawn system? Like having a spawn for police station, hospital, main spawn, random location...
Like having a taxi system, taking the user to random places across the map (should be set by admins), or even taking the
 user to specific landmark set.

So should the spawn system be for specific locations and warp for gangs/clans??

Create a waypoint class that saves location data into a database.
Save waypoint name.
Save x, y, z, and world locations.
Add type column for each waypoint: spawn, gang, warp, taxi, safe-zone, global.
Save if they are global, or gang. If it was gang-based, then have a column that saves these data.
Add cooldown column, each waypoint has a custom cooldown which makes every waypoint unique.
Add payment cost for each waypoint, so some waypoints are restricted by a certain cost.
Add teleport shield, which saves a value for how long the user is protected from attacks upon teleportation.
Add radius, thus if there was any effect in that radius it would be applied to the user.
