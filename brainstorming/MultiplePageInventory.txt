The page will have a next and previous
The page will also have a back options

To achieve that we can simply introduce the linked list prev and next nodes

There is another case where you are in a page with multiple linked list cases
Thus I can think about hashing them and using chaining, basically hash maps

Page 1:
 - Node 1.1
 - GOTO page a
 - GOTO page b
 - GOTO page c

Page a:
 - Node a.1
 - Node a.2
 - Node a.3
 - GOTO page d

Page b:
 - GOTO page b
 - GOTO page c
 - Node b.1
 - Node b.2

...

Thus to achieve that there are nodes which will point to heads, let us say linked lists
Each node (item) has a next, the previous statement can be either dynamic OR linked to the last occurrence

Let us think about it in this sense;

For faster inventory checks, use Map<NamespaceKey, InventoryGUI>
