	- Add custom inventories in YAML files.
		-> Interactive inventories that can be created by the user using YAML files.
		-> Contains static items, intractable items, and conditional items.
			-> Static items hold data (lore and name).
			-> Intractable items can open a new inventory page, navigate between inventories, and execute a command.
			-> Conditional items execute a process according to a condition set. (Can be done recursively)
	- Rework multi-inventory system.
		-> Should respect OOP standards.
		-> Creates a set of inventories according to a set of items.
    	-> Don't use static methods to create dynamic inventories.
    - Make inventories work with a multi-inventory system.
    	-> Enhance the multi-inventory system to work in YAML files.
