# | Update Config | #
# +---------------+ #

# If you have faced any problem with the file you can create a new one by changing [Config_Version] to a different
# number, but when a new update comes out with a new configuration file(s), [Config_Version] will change resulting
# in a new file(s) for that new version while saving old files with a suffix -old to indicate they are old.
## | WARNING |
# BY CHANGING [Config_Version] YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE LINKED FILES TO IT [Config_Version] TOO JUST TO AVOID ERRORS.
# THIS OPTION IS EXPERIMENTAL AND WILL TAKE SOME TIME TILL I FIGURE A SOLUTION FOR IT!
# CHANGE IT IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
Config_Version: '${project.version}'
# We recommend to leave it true so people that got the permission will receive an update message.
Show_Update: true # This will work next update. An update will release immediately.

# | Language Config | #
# +-----------------+ #

# Messages language type. You can create a custom language by simply creating a folder called 'message' and inside it
# the language. You should respect the prefix of the file name, it should be message_xx.yml, and xx can be any letter
# you prefer. To switch between the languages, you enter the xx values in 'Language' and it would load that
# configuration.
# Any faulty written language names entered this attribute 'Language', then the plugin would disable. To make the plugin
# work just use any valid language. To get the list of the available languages, just enter an invalid name, and a
# message of the available list suffix would be displayed.
Language: en
