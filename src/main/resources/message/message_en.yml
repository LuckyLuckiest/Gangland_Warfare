# If you have faced any problem with the file, you can create a new one by changing [Config_Version] to a different
# number, but when a new update comes out with a new configuration file(s), [Config_Version] will change resulting
# in a new file(s) for that new version while saving old files with a suffix -old to indicate they are old.
Config_Version: '${project.version}'
