# If you have faced any problem with the file you can create a new one by changing [Config_Version] to a different
# number, but when a new update comes out with a new configuration file(s), [Config_Version] will change resulting
# in a new file(s) for that new version while saving old files with a suffix -old to indicate they are old.
## | WARNING |
# BY CHANGING [Config_Version] YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE LINKED FILES TO IT [Config_Version] TOO JUST TO AVOID ERRORS.
# THIS OPTION IS EXPERIMENTAL AND WILL TAKE SOME TIME TILL I FIGURE A SOLUTION FOR IT!
# CHANGE IT IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!
Config_Version: 0
